# 🚀 Express.js + JSX Starter Project

This project is a simple and practical example of Express.js that uses **JSX** for server-side rendering instead of **EJS**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🛠️ **Component-Based**: Like React, you can build components and use them in your views.  
- 🏗️ **MVC Architecture**: The project includes simple examples for each part of the MVC pattern.  
- 🔄 **Hot Reloading**: Uses **Nodemon** for automatic updates on file changes.  
- ⚡ **Express-React-Views**: Fixes previous issues such as using multiple components simultaneously.

---

## 📋 Key Notes

- ⚙️ You can use **React components**, but **React Hooks** are not supported because rendering happens on the server.  
- 🔗 You can pass **data as props** to components and fully control how they render.
